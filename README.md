## The origin and significance
In an era of haste, people have to face pressures and stresses from various aspects, whether it’s work, finance, relationships, health, etc. These all have impacts on both physical and mental health problems. Therefore, spas play an increasingly important role in helping to relieve stress and alleviate pain and fatigue. 

Wimandin Spa is a comprehensive alternative health service shop located behind Khon Kaen University, behind the Noppharat dormitory. It has a serene atmosphere with a variety of services such as herbal steam, herbal bath, Thai massage, body spa, facial spa, aroma massage, milk bath for skin nourishment, oil massage, foot massage, skin scrub, etc. They also serve food and beverages. Moreover, it is a Thai massage and spa vocational training center. The services are reasonably priced. In addition, they always offer interesting promotions. The only way to view reviews or information about the shop is through their Facebook page.

Therefore, we are interested in creating a system to collect customer reviews and basic information about Wimandin Spa. This will provide Wimandin Spa with a convenient way to provide services and present information more easily. This system can also be beneficial or further developed in the future.
